Pseudocode on how to use an elevator for my robot
- to use the elevator to change floors do the following
    - call the elevator to your floor
        - press the button next to the elevator door if there is only one button to call the elevator
        - otherwise determine whether you want to go up or down relative to the floor you are on
            - many times you will see two buttons aligned vertically next to the elevator to either go up or down, press the top button if you wish to go up
            - otherwise press the bottom button to go down
    - when the elevator door arrives to your floor, it will open. Go inside
    - locate the navigation panel which contains a list of floors buttons
        - get off the elevator if you dont find the floor panel to be in number format, since i am not there to guide you you will get lost and wont know which floor to go to
        -otherwise you should see a list of floors available to you in number format with a few floors being the exception, 'B' is for basement, 'C','M', or 'L' are normally the main/lobby floor 
    - decide which floor you want to go to
    - press the floor number or letter of the floor you wish to go to and the fllor's button will illuminate
    - while your floor's button is no longer illuminated and the floor indicator on the top of the elevator sliding doors is illuminated, don't get off
        - otherwise, get off the elevator
    you have reached your elevator
- otherwise stay on your floor
