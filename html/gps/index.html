<!-- the following questions within that block comment:

What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags?
  The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags are to help the developer give more clarity and readablity to the code.
Which ones do you see as most useful?
  I see the header and footer being really useful to indicate where the code begins and ends.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
  The browser use a top down approach, starting with the doctype and then the information in the header and then on to the body and soon on.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge?
  I learned that you can edit/write snippits of code to minimize redundentcy.

Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
  Yes I do belive I will create more handy snippets in the future; i believe they are really useful.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you?
  The concept of the semantic tags was most difficult.

How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
  I can do more research on this topic and look at how other developers have used this code in their projects.
